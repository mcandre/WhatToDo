# WhatToDo

As a developer you probably know that situation: You've been hacking in a project for some weeks and suddenly you're stuck or don't have any time to complete or have to stop developing for some other reason. The project stays untouched in the git repository and is idling. Dome weeks or months or even years later you want to get back in the project and finish it or fix a bug or somethine like that. But you don't know were the fuck you have quit the work in the project and have no idea what to do next.

The same issue occurs if you're joining a new project or want to start to contribute to an OpenSource project. You have no idea where to start.

WhatToDo is a tool which aims to help you over that obstacle, by analysing your project and telling you what you can do. It gives you concrete todos to help you to get startet with the project and get back into it.

Works for ruby projects only currently.
